The weather app that i have made has the following features;
   a. Check Weather updates for all global cities
   b. check Weather update for your current location
   c. I have State mangaged the app using Bloc.
I did try to make a login page with firebase but i had encountered continious errors and i am currently in the process of implenting it.

One bug that i noticed was when i click on check weather for current location, the app does not move into loading state and moves into loading state only when location coordinates are obtained. I did try correcting it but could not find a solution.


I did use chatgpt to simplyfy my front end code. Chatgpt did suggest using build fucntions to give clarity to my code and make it easier and simpler to process and understand.
